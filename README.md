# hacktiv8-p0-csharp

This is my solution to Hacktiv8 Phase 0 Exercise, all of them in C#.
Feel free to ask PR or raise an issue if there's some mistakes in it.
The exercises itself is actually written for learning Javascript,
so I have to adjust the test solution (or in other word, reform
the exercise).
